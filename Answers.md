1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe() groups together several related tests. It is considered the test suite. It() or test() is the acutal test runner. 

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

The point of TDD is to test first. It relies on a very short development cycle and requirements are turned into modular test cases. This results in improved software, only if it passes new tests.

I think this approach is beneficial. It reduces bugs in the production environment. It helps insure the client will be pleased with the outcome. It reduces time in development of features that may not work or do not meet the client requirements.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit testing
Intrgration testing
Regression testing
